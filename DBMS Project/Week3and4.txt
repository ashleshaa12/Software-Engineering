Week 4 - Activity 1: Design use case diagram

Step 1: Write the number of actors and use cases for your college project, defining the scope of the project in the same way as the activity completed in Week 3 for your college.
The system allows students to register and enroll in courses, lecturers to teach assigned classes and record grades, and the admin to manage programs, departments, and timetables. 

We have three main actors:
1.	Students, who can register, enroll in courses, and check their grades or timetable.
2.	Lecturers, who can see their assigned classes and record student grades.
3.	Administrators, who manage everything – adding students, lecturers, courses, and generating reports.
 Use Cases: 6 (Register, Enroll, Assign Lecturer, and Manage Timetable, Record Grades, and View Reports)
